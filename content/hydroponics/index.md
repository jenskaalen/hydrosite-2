It's easy to overthink things, and when you dive into a new hobby on the internet it's easy to get wrapped up in what the opinionated longbeards say in reddit comments. I'm gonna try to in simple terms explain what you need for hydroponics and how you can make a setup that suits your needs.

These are the 4 main things you need to think about

## Substrate

While the roots will (usually) be in water, you still need something to hold the plant and grow into from the seedling stage. Usually this involves a net cup with your chosen growing media.

## Nutrition

Plants need to eat. This will be the nutrition you mix into the water. You need to buy specific hydroponic nutrients - plain water is not gonna cut it.

You can try to find an all-round nutrition if you're not sure what you're gonna grow. Something like Masterblend Tomatoes, for example. Follow the instructions!
The PH should ideally be between 5.8 - 6.5, roughly. Otherwise your plants won't be able to absorb all the nutrients.

For measuring how strong your nutrition is you can use an TDS/EC-meter. A PPM of 500-2000 is the typical range depending on what plants you are growing.

## Light

Plants need light to grow, we all know this.

If your plants are stretching and getting thin stems then they're not getting enough sunlight. Consider if you need grow lights.

I think actually a basic requirement though to get familiar with the basic levels of light you need.
So we're gonna use DLI to quantify sunlight. Plants need roughly around 10 to 30 DLI depending on your type of plant. Getting correct equipment for measuring this can be pricey, but you can use phone apps to get a rough idea (TODO: app examples). Also a device called UNI-T UT383BT is excellent value for money.

## System

There are various ways of keeping your little planties with wet roots. Just dropping them in a bucket might not be enough.
If you want something simple though you can go for the Kratky method: A container with water and nutrition. Nothing more. For starting growers just wanting to grow a lettuce I think this is great.

One popular system is the Deep Water Culture (DWC) system. It involves suspending the plant's roots in a nutrient-rich solution with an air pump providing oxygen to the roots.
Another option is the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system, where a thin film of nutrient solution flows over the roots, providing them with nutrients and oxygen.
There are also ebb and flow systems, aeroponic systems, and more.
