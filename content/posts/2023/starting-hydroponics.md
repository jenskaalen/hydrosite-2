It's easy to overthink things, and when you dive into a new hobby on the internet it's easy to get wrapped up in what the opinionated longbeards say in reddit comments. I'm gonna try to in simple terms explain what you need for hydroponics and how you can make a setup that suits your needs.

These are the 3 main things you need to think about

Substrate
While the roots will (usually) be in water, you still need something to hold the plant and grow into from the seedling stage. Usually this involves a net cup with your chosen growing media.

Nutrition
Plants need to eat. This will be the nutrition you mix into the water.

Light
Plants need light to grow, we all know this.
